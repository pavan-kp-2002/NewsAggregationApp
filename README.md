The News Aggregation project consists of a Server and a Client application. The Server application 
collects news feeds from various sources via API calls, processes and sorts the received JSON 
responses, and provides structured news data when requested by the Client application. The Client 
application features user authentication, allowing users to log in, browse news content, and save 
specific articles. The Server application stores saved news and user data in a database, ensuring 
efficient user management and content retrieval.
